(ns guis.flights)

;; The task is to build a frame containing:
;;
;; - a combobox C with the two options "one-way flight" and "return flight"
;;   - initial value: "one-way flight"
;; - a textfield T1 representing the start date
;;   - initial value: arbitrary date
;; - a textfield T2 representing the return date
;;   - initial value: arbitrary date
;;   - initially disabled
;; - a button B for submitting the selected flight
;;
;; - T2 is enabled if, and only if, Câ€™s value is "return flight".
;;
;; - When a non-disabled textfield T has an ill-formatted date then:
;;   - T is colored red
;;   - B is disabled
;;
;; - When:
;;   - C has the value "return flight"
;;   - T2â€™s date is strictly before T1â€™s
;;   => Then B is disabled.
;;
;; - When clicking B a message is displayed informing the user of their selection
;;   (e.g. "You have booked a one-way flight on 2025.04.24.").
